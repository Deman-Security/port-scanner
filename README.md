# Port Scanner

This project is a simple port scanner written in Python. It allows you to scan a range of ports on a target IP address to check for open ports.

## Usage

1. Run the port scanner script:
    ```sh
    python port_scanner.py <target_ip> <start_port> <end_port>
    ```
    Replace `<target_ip>`, `<start_port>`, and `<end_port>` with the target IP address and the range of ports you want to scan.
